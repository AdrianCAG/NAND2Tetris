Welcome to the NAND2Tetris project repository! This project is an exciting journey that takes you from building a basic computer using NAND gates all the way to creating a simple computer game. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn about computer architecture and gain hands-on experience in creating software from the ground up.


## About NAND2Tetris


Nand2Tetris is a project created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken to teach the fundamental concepts of computer systems. The project begins by teaching the user how to build a computer from scratch, using only NAND gates. The user then learns how to write assembly language programs for their computer, and then how to write higher-level languages, such as C and Java.

1. **Hardware Construction**: You'll start by building basic logic gates using NAND gates and gradually assemble a complete computer hardware system, including a CPU, memory, and input/output devices.

2. **Software Development**: Once you have your computer hardware ready, you'll write low-level assembly programs and develop a simple high-level programming language (Jack) compiler. Eventually, you'll create various software applications, including games!

This repository contains the materials and resources required to complete the NAND2Tetris course.

## Additional tips

- Start by working on the first few projects. These projects will teach you the basics of building a computer and writing assembly language programs.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. The Nand2Tetris forum is a great resource for getting help from other users.
- Use the Nand2Tetris simulator to test your hardware design and assembly language programs.
- Don't give up! Nand2Tetris is a challenging project, but it is also very rewarding.
